## Context
Something that is really popular nowadays is skincare. It doesnâ€™t matter if you are a man or a woman, identifying your 
skin type and having the right routine to achieve beautiful skin is an important thing that can make you look better 
and healthier.

## Objective
Essentially this dataset is for training machine learning while I also acquire knowledge in other libraries and 
types of data, such as images, which pose the biggest challenge in this project.

## Datasets
All the sources that I used were downloaded from Kaggle.
 - Oily, Dry and Normal Skin Types Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shakyadissanayake/oily-dry-and-normal-skin-types-dataset
 - Amazon Skincare Products: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/namantrisoliya/amazon-skincare-products

## Process
After downloading all the datasets that I needed, I opened VsCode to start investigating my data. I realized that it would
be necessary some other libraries  that I  had never used, so I started searching for some online materials that would help 
me solve some of the problems that I was encountering.

Firstly I found some videos and websites talking about some libraries that are important for when we are using images such as
Opencv and Matplotlib. I did some experiments while accompaning some tutorials and learned new things.
